# Data Warehousing in the Cloud
Data warehouses traditionally exist inside an organizationâ€™s local infrastructure (on-premises), where the responsibility for configuration and maintenance lies solely on information technology (IT) staff at the organization. Data warehousing in the cloud shifts much of the responsibility for hardware, networking, security, and maintenance to a third party, which allows the organization to focus more on business goals and objectives. This approach also allows users (who are often remote or mobile) a higher, more consistent level of data warehouse availability.
