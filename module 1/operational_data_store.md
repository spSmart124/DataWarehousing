# Operational Data Stores
An operational data store (ODS) utilizes snapshots of operational or transactional systemsâ€™ data to provide operational business reporting. ODS differs from a data warehouse because the data is accessed directly from the transactional system databases, and the operational data store is able to write data back to the source systems. A primary purpose of an operational data store is to deal with the complexities of maintaining up-to-date data in the data warehouse. Thus, the ODS can be seen as a less expensive approach to real-time data reporting.
