# Data Modeling for Data Warehousing
In the first course of the Database Design and Operational Business Intelligence specialization, we saw the importance of data modeling in database design and implementation. This also applies to data warehousing. The process of data modeling remains the same, the goal being “the organization and storage of long-term data for analysis and reporting.” The data model needs to support the basic characteristics of a data warehouse, i.e., be subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, non-volatile, and summarized. The data modeling process for data warehousing still follows the design process— from conceptual to logical to physical ERDs (entity-relationship diagrams). Another area to consider is the selected data warehouse architecture (i.e., dimensional or normalized), and whether data marts will be incorporated into the architecture.
