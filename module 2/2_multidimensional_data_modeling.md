Multidimensional data models represent complex data structures (typically in a cube format) as opposed to a single dimension (often represented by a list). Two- and three-dimensional data models are often utilized in data warehousing. These models enable a well-defined structure and organization of data. The general steps in constructing a multidimensional data model include:

* Collecting user requirements
* Categorizing the modules of the system
* Identifying dimensions to organize data around objects and functions
* Drafting the real-time dimensions and the corresponding properties
* Discovering the facts from the dimensions and their properties
* Constructing the schema for data storage
