# Overview of Data Mining for BI

Data mining is the process of discovering insights or information from databases and uncovering patterns from the data. This process relies on the processing power and speed of a computer to search large datasets where pattern discovery may be difficult for humans. The focus is not actually on the extraction (mining) of data but rather on gaining knowledge and identifying patterns. There are two types of data mining models which weâ€™ll explore throughout this and the next module: predictive and descriptive/explanatory. 

Data mining can also be classified into supervised and unsupervised learning:

Supervised Learning: Training data is labeled and categorized well and is used to evaluate accuracy. The training data set contains the expected answer and is used to validate the algorithm.

Unsupervised Learning: Training data is unlabeled and learning occurs based on feedback without explicit instructions on how to proceed. The training data contains no desired outcomes or correct answers.
