# Data Mining Methods

There are many methods by which we can perform data mining functions and tasks. Some will be introduced in this module (as seen below) and some in Module 4:

* Classification: determines what categories or groupings an observation belongs to

* Prediction: decision support function based on forecasting and prediction of trends

* Regression: prediction technique to identify a potential range of values for a given problem

* Time Series Analysis: analysis over time intervals to identify trends and patterns

* Clustering: identifies similar observations and combines them into clusters or groups for analysis

* Summarization: compacts descriptive attributes of a dataset to offer a short conclusion

* Association Rules: involves searching for if-then patterns in the dataset based on specific criteria and a confidence interval; establishes relationship among observations

* Sequence Discovery: used to discover statistically relevant patterns by analyzing specific criteria; seeks hidden patterns and uncovering new information
