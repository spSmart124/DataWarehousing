# Unsupervised Data Mining for Explanatory Modeling

Unsupervised data mining is a technique that provides no explicit instructions, desired outcomes, or correct answers as inputs to the algorithm. For explanatory or descriptive modeling, this approach allows the algorithm to explore a dataset and naturally discover patterns. This can result in fascinating findings, so the outputs often need to be reviewed by an analyst or data scientist for validity and context.
