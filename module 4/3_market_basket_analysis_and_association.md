# Association and Market Basket Analysis
Association in data mining involves searching for if-then patterns in the dataset (based on specific criteria and a confidence interval) and establishing relationships among observations. This approach leads us to the concept of market basket analysis (MBA), which is best explained by an example. If we operate a grocery store and have data that supports the fact that when a customer purchases Coca-Cola in a 20 oz. bottle, they will also purchase a bag of potato chips 98% of the time, we would want to ensure that we never put a sale price on both Coca-Cola bottles and potato chips at the same time. We may also consider physically moving the associated products to different locations in the store to entice customers to pick up additional items for purchase along their route. Essentially, association and market basket analysis work to predict the occurrence of an outcome or behavior based on the occurrence of another item.

Apriori Algorithm for Association
Apriori algorithm is the given name of the classic association algorithm which seeks to confirm associations in a dataset. This is the underlying algorithm that drives market basket analysis and association in large datasets.
